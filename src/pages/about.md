## 👋🏻 About Me

G'Day! I'm Justin Adler - a [software engineer](https://github.com/purekrome), a father, a long time fan of electronic music (who occasionally [spins vinyl / digital choons](https://www.twitch.com/purekrome)).

I'm currently working as a .NET Lead at [Angle Auto Finance](https://anglefinance.com.au) in Melbourne, Australia - which is an exciting startup revolutionizing car financing Down Under. Prior to that I've worked mainly at [Homely](https://homely.com.au) as a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead, as well as various contracting and consulting roles (after work) over the years. You can find my full resume and work history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-adler-pk/).

I enjoy working on Open Source projects and have contributed to various initiatives over the years. I've created [Simple Authentication (now archived)](https://github.com/purekrome/Simple-Authentication) and [Simple Azure Storage Hybrid Queues](https://github.com/PureKrome/SimpleAzure.Storage.HybridQueues) and [HttpClient Helpers](https://github.com/PureKrome/HttpClient.Helpers).

Another Open Source intiative I tried to kickstart was an open Schema for Real-Estate data called [
Open RealEstate](https://github.com/OpenRealEstate)
