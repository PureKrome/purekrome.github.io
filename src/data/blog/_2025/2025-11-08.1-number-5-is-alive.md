Number 5 is alive!

I've been online since 1994 when I first connected to the internet via Mozaic Browser on a crappy uni thin client computer in a quiet computer lab.

Mind Blown.

I've never been interested in blogging or podcasting or creating a popular online presence. I've always struggled to find a digital home to keep my notes and thoughts - like a digital notebook. I've tried Gists and other archived platforms but I've always felt fragmented and disconnected.

So here we are in 2025 and I'm finally taking control and starting my digitial notebook.

I'll be jotting down notes about my work and life experiences to help future you and future me.
