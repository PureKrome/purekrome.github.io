# ANNOUNCEMENT: Simple Observability is now available!

Simple: Observability is a lightweight web application designed to help monitor your backend services for

- uptime
- versions

It evolved out of my need to see what versions our microservices were running in various environments without the complexity of full-blown observability platforms. At [Angle Auto Finance](https://angleauto.com.au), we have multiple microservices deployed across different environments, and keeping track of their versions was becoming a challenge.

For example:

| Service Name | Environment | Version    | Notes    |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Service_A    | Production  | v2.0.1     |          |
| Service_B    | Production  | v2.0.1     |          |
| Service_A    | Development | v3.9.5     |          |
| Service_B    | Development | **v3.6.6** | ❌ WRONG |
| Service_C    | Development | v3.9.5     |          |
| Service_D    | Development | v3.9.5     |          |

When multiple people are all deploying their code updates to various services, it's easy for versions to get out of sync. Simple: Observability helps identify these discrepancies quickly.

## How is this achieved?

Adding some extra metadata to your service's health endpoint is all it takes. For example, a simple JSON response like this:

```json
{
  "serviceName": "Service_A",
  "version": "2.0.1",
  "environment": "Production",
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-23T10:30:00Z"
}
```

and the Simple: Observability dashbord application will periodically poll these endpoints, aggregate the data, and present it in an easy-to-read dashboard:
