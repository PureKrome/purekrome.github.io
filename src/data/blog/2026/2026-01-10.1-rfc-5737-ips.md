# Today I learnt ....

_You (should) never stop learning._

I've been working with IP addresses since 1994 when I first had access to a network at 1st year Uni. Pretty quickyly I learned about public vs private IPs, and the various reserved ranges

- 10.0.0.0/8 - Class A (16.7M addresses)
- 172.16.0.0/12 - Class B (1M addresses)
- 192.168.0.0/16 - Class C (65k addresses)

and I've personally used the Class C range the most in home and small business networks.

**But these were always for private networks.**

Today I learned that there's more reserved IP ranges beyond the private network ones - for docs!

# RFC 5737 IPs: Reserved for Documentation and Examples

- 192.0.2.0/24 - TEST-NET-1
- 198.51.100.0/24 - TEST-NET-2
- 203.0.113.0/24 - TEST-NET-3

These IP ranges are reserved by [RFC 5737](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5737) specifically for use in documentation and examples. This means that they should not be used in real-world networks, as they are not routable on the public internet.

**This makes so much sense** I'm embarassed I've never had to use them before now.

## Side quest: Email addresses for documentation, examples and tests

Just like IP addresses, there are reserved email addresses for documentation and examples. These are defined in [RFC 2606](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2606) and include:

- example.com
- example.net
- example.org

I've been using `example.com` for years and years for my test data, etc.

So now the circle is complete!
