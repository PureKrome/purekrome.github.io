# Righty-o then! Off I go, then!

I love it when people create fun and silly projects.

Tony Yont has created a set of voice sound effects for AI, inspired by the peon character from Warcraft. You can find the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/tonyyont/peon-ping).

It wired up various sounds to your AI agent so instead of waiting for the 'toast' to pop up, you get a peon sound effect instead. It's a fun way to grab your attention that the agent has completed a task or is waiting for input.

But wait, there's more! There's also a "sound board" of other sounds, not even related to Warcraft. It's just mp3's so people have been adding all sorts:

- Orc Peon (from Warcraft 3)
- Human Peasant (from Warcraft 3)
- Soviet Engineer (from Red Alert 2)
- Battlecruiser (from StarCraft)
- Sarah Kerrigan (from StarCraft)

and having a quick look at the PR's there's a TF2 Engineer sound effect!

How annoying would this get after a while? I don't know, but it sure is fun to have a laugh at the idea of peon sounds popping up every time your AI agent does something.
